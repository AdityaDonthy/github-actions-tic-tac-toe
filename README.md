# Tic Tac Toe Game

This project is a simple node js app(game) built to learn GitHub Actions. We will be implementing a CI/CD workflow for this repo

The github worlflow is as follows: A feature branch is created, tested and reviewed and then the branch is merged to 
Master and master is then deployed to the prod.

Github ```workflow``` is mode up of at least one ```job```.
Each ```job``` can be made up of multiple steps
Each ```step``` can run a command. A step can also be defined as an ```action`` 
```action``` Actions are the building blocks that power your workflow. A workflow can contain actions created by the community, or you can create our own actions directly within your application's repository

We can search and browse actions in market plae from directly in our repository's workflow editor. From the sidebar, you can search for a specific action, view featured actions
